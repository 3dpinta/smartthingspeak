===============

Example Python script to read data from a SmartThings home automation system.

If you need to read in multiple pieces of information, see the comments and duplicate certain sections in the script.

Use at your risk. SmartThings may change the format of their data in the future so this script may need future modification. It's likely things will change as I have seen them change things up the last few weeks but it shouldn't be an issue to make modifications as necessary.
